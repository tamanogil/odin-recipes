    <h2>Descripttion</h2>
    <p>When I make this soup, I always get rave reviews. The tarragon gives it a special taste. Tastes great the next day for leftovers! To be honest I don't measure the ingredients when I make this recipe, so this is my best guess at how much of each I use. This makes a very thick soup, with a bite of something in every spoonful. If too thick, add more water or chicken broth.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken soup base, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried tarragon</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>6 carrots, diced</li>
            <li>6 stalks celery, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a Dutch oven or stockpot about 3/4 full with water; mix chicken base, tarragon, basil, and black pepper into water and bring to a boil. Cook chicken in the boiling broth mixture until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove chicken from broth, leaving broth in Dutch oven to simmer. Dice chicken and add it back to the simmering broth.</li>
            <li>Mix rice, onion, carrot, celery, and garlic into simmering broth; cook until rice is tender and soup is thickened, 25 to 30 minutes. Add more water if needed.</li>
        </ol>
