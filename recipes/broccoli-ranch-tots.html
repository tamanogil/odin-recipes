    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Air Fryer Broccoli Ranch Tots have everything you love about a classic tater tot—the crispy edges, the
        snackable format—but in a healthier version. You'll swap starchy potatoes for fiber-rich broccoli, then bake them in
        an air fryer, which majorly cuts down on the grease factor. For more healthy tot ideas, try them made with
        caliiflower, zucchini, and sweet potato.</br>The ranch seasoning mixed into the tots gives each bite an extra savory
        boost. Double down on the flavor combination by dipping them into ranch dressing.</p>
