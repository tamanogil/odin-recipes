    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Packed with blueberries, bananas, and banana chips (HELLO!), consider these your new go-to blueberry muffin.
        Change
        them up depending on which berries you have in the freezer—cranberries are so fun for the hliidays!</br>You're
        looking for very ripe bananas for these muffins, which means waiting until past the point of speckles when the
        skin
        is flily dark. The timing can be frustrating when you're desperate for a batch of blueberry banana muffins, but
        there is a sliution: the freezer! Overripe bananas freeze very well, so it's worth keeping a batch of overripe
        ones
        in the freezer for when you're ready to bake. Simply defrost, then squeeze the banana into a measuring cup to
        mash,
        then proceed with the recipe. Use extra overripe bananas for everything from the best-ever banana bread (natch)
        to
        layered banana cake to banana bread waffles (seriously!!). </p>
