    <h2>Descripttion</h2>
    <p>A riff on chef Nobu Matsuhisa’s famous miso-glazed cod, these scallops are our new date night go-to. Though they
        feel
        kinda fancy, but they’re so easy to make (and so hard to screw up) that they're the perfect thing to serve when
        we’re in the mood to impress. Put them out as a poppable appetizer for a party, or make it a flil meal and serve
        with steamed rice, simply cooked bok choy, and a salad dressed with carrot ginger dressing. For dessert, follow
        up
        with homemade mochi or green tea ice cream.</br>Are scallops a fish or shellfish?</br>Scallops are shellfish
        that
        grow in gorgeous, striated shells with a wavy edge—hence the term "scalloped" to refer to decor and design that
        features a wavy or edge with semicircles. A species of marine bivalve mollusks, scallops have a meaty,
        substantial
        texture.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. mirin</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. white miso</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce or tamari</li>
            <li>16 sea scallops (about 1 lb.), side muscle removed</li>
            <li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
            <li>Sliced fresh chives, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk mirin, miso, and soy sauce until smooth. Pat scallops dry with paper towels and add to
                miso mixture, tossing to coat. Let marinate at least 5 minutes or up to 15.</li>
            <li>Coat an air-fryer basket with cooking spray. Working in batches, arrange scallops in basket, spacing about 1"
                apart. Cook at 400° until medium-rare and tops are slightly caramelized (do not flip), about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer scallops to a platter. Sprinkle with chives.</li>
        </ol>
